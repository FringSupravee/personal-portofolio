If we would be able to provide platform with resources on sex and other topics related to sex, this can be a game changer to sex education landscape in Hong Kong by giving a reliable information with non-judgmental mediators."</i> </.p>

                            <li>We agree that to remove the taboo of openly sex-related conversation in Asia, we need to start from a young age.</li>
                            <li>Due to the perception about sex in Asian countries and sex education, women have a higher rate of early pregnancy and unprotected sex than Western countries with proper sex education.</li>
                            <li>We want to increase awareness about gender diversity and remove the gender norm to express themselves freely.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Moreover, our team consists of students from different countries, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Poland, and Switzerland. So we agree that we can research from different beliefs and perceptions of each country and compare Europe's sex education in middle school.</p>

                            <p>We asked around our friends and classmates from different backgrounds and types of school, which we see in Asia. The national school type touched only briefly about the sex education in the biology class where the lesson is about 'human body.' The current curriculum only consisted of the reproductive system of males and females. Although there are more sex education courses in the international school, it is only one hour per week for 1 year. Fortunately, the lesson covered more than the reproduction system; the international school also touched on birth control methods like contraception or wearing a proper condom.</p>
